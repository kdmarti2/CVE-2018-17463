# CVE-2018-17463
Completed a working exploit for CVE-2018-17463 for fun.

The original writeup that I found on this bug was here http://phrack.org/papers/jit_exploitation.html. I just really wanted to change this arb r/w into a fully working exploit.

Also I learned the JIT spray technique from the following paper which is an interesting read.
